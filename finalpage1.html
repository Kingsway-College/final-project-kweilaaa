        What is my project 
    </h2>  
    
    <p>
        My project was originally supposed to be a train track but instead I turned it into a spiderman  themed road. The road lights up two LED lights and makes road blocker go up when motion is detected using a motion sensor. The road also makes noise using the beeper. I think that my project is pretty cool and I made it spiderman themed because he is my favourtie character. I think that this would be really fun to play with for someone who likes card because of the lights and the different things that it can do. To sum all that up it is basically just a road where cars can go past so you can play with you cars on it

        Challenges I faced
    </h2>

    <p>
        Some of the challenges I faced was starting my project pretty late. I started my project less than a week before it was due so I had very limited time as to what I could build. Another challenge I faced was not really knowing how to code what I wanted to make. I did face quite some challenges when it came to coding what I wanted to make. I didnt really understand what I was doing but even through that I still was able to build what I wanted to and design it how I wanted to.

    <h2 class="class2">
        What I would change
    </h2>

    <p>
        Something that I would change is adding more detail to the actual design. Although I do like the color scheme and the small little spider webs around the road I wish that I would have been able to change the design and add more detail and more fun stuff to it. Technically that not that important but I would have really liked to be able to add more to the actual design of the project. 
    </p>

<h2 class="class2"> 
    why should someone buy this? 
</h2>
        <p>
            someone should buy this because it would be very fun and entertaining to play with. There arent many car tracks in the world that light up and do all the cool stuff that the one that I made does so thats why someone should buy it instead of the other ones that you can find.
